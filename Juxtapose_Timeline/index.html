<h3>With a move back to RFK imminent, fans have one man to thank the most</h3>

<p>Jayden Daniels has turned the Commanders from a rebuilding franchise in the gutter to a Super Bowl contender. His calmness the pocket, elusiveness as a runner and quick decision-making have stabilized an offense that struggled for many years. Fans who drifted during the lean years have bought back in, and the locker room clearly has as well. The timing pairs perfectly with the franchise’s decision to return to its roots at RFK, where plans for a new stadium are in progess. Daniels and RFK and working together to bring the swagger back to football in the District. The synergy between a player finding his footing and a team reclaiming its home gives Washington a rare sense of continuity. In a city built on change, Daniels offers something the Commanders and their fans have chased for decades: stability and a future worth believing in.</p>
