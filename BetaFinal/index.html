<!--STORY-->
<p>The fastball has never been more important in baseball than it is right now. From high school fields to major league stadiums, velocity has become the focal point when evaluating a pitcher’s talent.</p>

<p>However, this need for speed has started to come at a cost. Elbow injuries, specifically ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tears that almost always require Tommy John (TJ) surgery, are rising across all levels of the game.</p></a>

<p>While this issue is most visible in the major leagues, the trend is also affecting younger players.</p>

<p>High school pitchers are routinely throwing in the upper 80s and low 90s, a velocity previously only seen from collegiate and professional players. From 2005 to 2019, there was a statistically significant <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666639125000720?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"> increase</a> in the rate of serious elbow injuries among high school baseball players, according to ScienceDirect.</p>

<p>Luke Dellentash remembers when he tore his UCL in 2022 while pitching for his club team. His velocity immediately dropped from his typical upper 80s range to 75 mph. While every injury has its own set of contributing factors, Dellentash’s pitching coach, Niko Leontarakis, said he believes the push for velocity plays a major role in most elbow injuries.</p>
<p>The demand for velocity in youth baseball is because kids want to catch the attention of college coaches and recruiters, <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/high-school/baseball/2024/05/23/tommy-john-surgeries-rise-high-school-baseball/73788568007/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=true&gca-epti=z113527d00----v113527d--39--b--39--&gca-ft=140&gca-ds=sophi" target="_blank">Leontarakis said</a>.</p>

<p>The pressure continues to intensify in college baseball even more.</p>

<p>The average fastball velocity in Division I baseball has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/04/22/college-baseball-velocity/" target="_blank">increased</a> similarly to the trend seen in the MLB. Programs across the country are building pitching labs focused on mechanics and training for pitchers to throw as hard as possible.</p>

<!--STORY-->
<p>Interestingly enough, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23259671241311601" target="_blank">study</a> from the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Division I pitchers who played in warm climates underwent UCL reconstruction surgery at a much higher rate than those playing in cold locations.</p>

<p>University of Maryland freshman pitcher Sammy Berman underwent TJ last May after tearing his UCL during his senior season. He said he was devastated not to be on the mound for his team’s playoff run, but understands the risks and rewards of being a hard thrower.</p>

<p>Currently, Berman is slowly returning to baseball activities while continuing his rehab during his first semester at Maryland.</p>

<p>The problem becomes even more pronounced once pitchers are drafted and reach the professional leagues.</p>

<!--STORY-->
<p>In 2002, the average MLB fastball clocked in at 89.0 mph. By 2024, this number had risen all the way to 93.9 mph, according to Fangraphs.</p>

<p>This spike in velocity has directly coincided with a rise in elbow injuries, especially among major leaguers. In 2002, there were 35 reported cases of pitchers undergoing TJ. Just last year, in 2024, there were 107 instances, with a peak of 172 in 2021.</p>

<p>The rise of serious elbow injuries has forced many to question whether the emphasis on velocity in baseball has gone too far.</p>

<p>C.C. Sabathia, a six-time all-star, Cy Young winner and most importantly, a hall of famer, said that pitchers nowadays are focusing too much on velocity and not learning how to actually pitch.</p>

</div>

<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">

<p>“They're teaching velocity now. I can take my 12-year-old right now, and in five years I can make him throw 90 miles an hour," Sabathia said. “It’s a lot less pitchers and a lot more throwers.”</p>

<p>But pitchers are not just throwing harder now — they are throwing differently. High-speed cameras and pitch-tracking technology have allowed pitchers to break down every frame and millisecond of their motion and analyze what they can improve. This allows them to throw harder and get more spin on their breaking balls, placing even more stress on the elbow.</p>

<div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell">

<p>The modern-day pitching style demands maximum effort on nearly every pitch, leaving little room for rest to preserve arm health.</p>

<p>While pushing for velocity has certainly been proven to be a major factor in causing torn UCLs, it is by no means the only one. Many pitchers who have had TJ feel that overuse was the leading cause of their injuries. That is certainly the case for Frostburg State pitcher Liam Bowen.</p>

<!--STORY-->
<p>The junior tore his UCL the summer after graduating high school, forcing him to miss the entirety of his freshman season. Despite being one of the hardest throwers on his team, it was over-throwing and exhaustion that led to the injury, Bowen said.</p>

<p>Leading up to the injury, his arm was dragging and felt heavy, Bowen said.</p>

<p>Dellentash, Berman and Bowen are just three examples of a nationwide trend. Across all levels of baseball, pitchers are being asked to do more with their arms than ever before.</p>

<p>The technology is better, the training is more advanced and the incentives to throw harder are exponentially higher.</p>

<p>However, until baseball finds a way to reward pitchers for durability as much as velocity, this trend of rising speeds and injuries will continue.</p>
